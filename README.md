Original Project is private and owned by the school. So this is a copied from the original project file.

ReType: Quick Text Editing with Keyboard and Gaze is an application developed jointly by Dr. Shyamli Sindhwani, Dr. Gerald Webber from the University of Auckland, and Dr. Christof Lutteroth from the University of Bath, and published in 2019 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems. This ReType application makes everyday interactions more fluent for professional keyboard users. However, we are inspired by the concept of the ReType application and decided to further extend its keyboard typing capabilities from its plugin based on Microsoft Word and gamify it to make it accessible to a broader audience.
